Several datasets provided with this package were compiled and are maintained
manually in Google Sheets. These sheets are publicly accessible with links
provided in the text below.

```{r libraries}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(googlesheets4)
library(data.table)
```

This script downloads tables from Google Sheets. Putting multiple downloads in
one Rmd file reduces to one the number of times one has to enter a Google ID.

Tables in script:

* viaf 
* whoswho 
* nobels 

## Google authorization

The sheets are public but you need a Google account to access them. This
single authentication provides access to the three tables below.

```{r google-auth}
gm <- readline(prompt = "Google account: ")
gs4_auth(scopes = "spreadsheets.readonly", email = gm)
```

## viaf

The Virtual International Authority File (VIAF) provides access to
more that 50 name authority files worldwide.[@viaf20240325] The VIAF portal tracks International
library holdings by author and is an important data source for quantifiable records of authors and their
publications [@conroy2019networks]. This data package imports
Stephanie Schneider's viafr package for R [@R-viafr] to
query information from VIAF. 

The manually compiled [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l8y_tp55rojn73308TTLr2yq_nZaeJC5v6CnKrZvS0s/edit?usp=sharing)
contains 5 columns. The 5th column, which is not downloaded, contains reference links that were used
in disambiguating names that could not be readily disambiguated with
information contained in the VIAF record. 

```{r viaf}
ss <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l8y_tp55rojn73308TTLr2yq_nZaeJC5v6CnKrZvS0s/edit?usp=sharing"
viaf <- read_sheet(ss,
                   sheet = "VIAF",
                   range = "A:D",
                   col_types = "cccc",
                   na = "N", trim_ws = TRUE)
viaf$VIAF <- ifelse(is.na(viaf$VIAF), NA, strsplit(viaf$VIAF, split = "\n"))
viaf <- unnest(viaf, VIAF)
viaf
```

## whoswho

The main table in this dataset, \code{participants}, is a list of 2045 people
who have been listed in ICUS programs as speakers, moderators, discussants,
advisors and other committee members. For the purpose of assessing the roles
of Nobel Laureates and other famous persons, the full list was looked up
in three editions of Marquis International Who's Who Editions 40 [@intlwhoswho1976],
50 [@intlwhoswho1986] and 60 [@intlwhoswho1996]. This data is in the 
\code{whoswho.rda} file.

These editions cover the first, middle and final thirds of the ICUS
conferences that ran from 1992 to 2000. 

For ease of handling during manual lookups, the origional datasheet was
compiled as a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l8y_tp55rojn73308TTLr2yq_nZaeJC5v6CnKrZvS0s/edit?usp=sharing),
which can be easily accessed via phone. These
wide tables are included with the dataset in the \code{inst/extdata} folder.

The table \code{whoswho} itself is in long form in the \code{whoswho.rda} file.

```{r whoswho}

                 sheet = "WhosWho",
                 range = "A:F",
                 col_types = "cccccc",
                 na = "N", trim_ws = TRUE)
ww1 <- as.data.table(ww)
write.csv(ww,
          file = file.path(project_path(), "inst", "extdata", "whoswho.csv"),
          fileEncoding = "utf8")
write.table(ww1,
            file = file.path(project_path(), "inst", "extdata", "whoswho.tsv"),
            row.names = FALSE, sep = "\t")
whoswho <- melt(ww1, id.vars = c("ID", "Surname", "Given"),
                measure.vars = c("IntlWW40", "IntlWW50", "IntlWW60"),
                variable.name = "Edition",
                value.name = "Birthdate", na.rm = TRUE)
whoswho
```


## nobels

In his 1977 criticism of ICUS IV, Irving Horowitz noted the prominence of Nobel
Laureates on the program and a striking fall-off in talent beyond a stellar list of
sponsors [@horowitz1977science]. This table is based on the Nobel Media AB
dataset [@nobelprizelaureates2023]. This data was manually compiled in a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f09qZiFsVZVLnoSUMfkGqw7cpk1Y4OG9OvW3qnSVSwE/edit?usp=sharing).

The categories are:

* C - Chemistry
* E - Economics
* M - Medicine and physiology
* P - Physics
* S - Peace

```{r nobels}
ss <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f09qZiFsVZVLnoSUMfkGqw7cpk1Y4OG9OvW3qnSVSwE/edit?usp=sharing"
nobels <- as.data.table(read_sheet(ss,sheet="Nobels", na="N",trim_ws=TRUE))[Year > 1800]
nobels
```
