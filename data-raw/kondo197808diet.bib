annotation={p45~ 宮島龍興 (Miyajima Tatsuoki), member of the Atomic Energy Commission
(see http://www.aec.go.jp/jicst/NC/about/ugoki/geppou/V19/N04/197402V19N04.html), attended
ICUS held in November 1974. In the Diet on 5 June, JCP Member Ichikawa Shoichi (市川 正一)
(http://webcatplus.nii.ac.jp/webcatplus/details/creator/133372.html) questioned
about giving Miyajima permission to attend ICUS given comments ICUS founder Moon
had made. 宗像 英二(Munekata Eiji) was also a topic because he contributed
to PWPA's journal Quarterly Academy, No. 10. The director of STA, Kumatani, 
contributed to Sekai Nippo, 4 Jan 1977. \par
