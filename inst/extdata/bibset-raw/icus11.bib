  abstract ={Many scientists think that creation evolved out of chaos and that
  we are living in a chancy world. They tend to neglect the thinking of the
  Creator that goes into every aspect of creation, and to characterize
  life as a chance phenomenon.\par
  The purpose of this session will be to demonstrate purely from scientific
  considerations that the organization of matter, be it inert or living,
  be it at the microscopic or macroscopic level, is only part of a Grand
  Schema of the Creator. An attempt to provide a unified view of the forces
  of nature and its implications for the existence of living and inert
  matter will be made.}
